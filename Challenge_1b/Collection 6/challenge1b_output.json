      "section_title": "Nanoparticles as Imaging Agents Conventional imaging using plain radiographs, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has traditionally been used in both cancer screening and follow-up. However, all these modalities rely on detecting cancer once it becomes a visible physical entity, at around 1 cm, 3   at which point the tumor mass will already contain approximately 1 billion cancer cells. 141   Over the past decade, there has therefore been a paradigm shift from ana- tomical imaging, which detects macroscopic/gross pathol- ogy, to molecular imaging, which has the potential to detect cancer much earlier at the molecular level, long before phe- notypic changes occur. Molecular imaging allows the genetic changes involved in oncogenesis to be characterized in vivo, thereby predicting the type of molecular therapy that will prove most bene\ufb01cial for the patient (ie, personalized medi- cine). It also allows the repeated noninvasive monitoring of the disease for response, progression, and transformation fol- lowing therapy or recurrence.

      "refined_text": "The early diagnosis of lung cancer remains a challenge because most of the available techniques and methodologies currently in use can detect cancer in advanced stages when treatment and a cure may not be ef\ufb01cient to control the disease. Thus, although signi\ufb01cant progress happened over the last years, early diagnosis is still not accurate. Lung cancer is mainly diagnosed by bronchoscopy and biopsies. In the case of bronchoscopy, it appears that the experience of the bronchoscopist is crucial for an accurate diagnosis. Although bronchoscopy is a minimally invasive technique with discomfort for the patients, complications can arise, especially if biopsies are taken from the suspicious tissue. Then, screening for early lung cancer development is required for an early therapy that can improve the outcome of the disease. In recent years, the search for biomarkers in human \ufb02uids has been an attractive methodology that has progressed in the right way. For instance, studies have shown that sputum, blood, and urine samples can answer the demand for biomarkers. Most of the published biomarkers are detected by PCR, metabolomics, or by other molecular biology techniques that will provide fast results for early intervention. In addition, the use of urine samples has proven that the detection of a metabolite in lung cancer is feasible, and it can be performed in a matter of hours. Int. J. Mol. Sci.  2021 ,  22 , 8661 15 of 18 In summary, we believe that the trend in the development of more reliable tests for early diagnosis of lung cancer should be focused on biomarker discovery that will alleviate the discomfort of the patients, as well as the burden for the health authorities, as the techniques and methodologies currently in use are expensive."

      "refined_text": "The gold standard for cancer con\ufb01rmation is a biopsy of the tissues. Lung tissue biopsy samples must have adequate tissue material to identify the subtype of lung cancer by histopathology procedures. The initial biopsy is critical to con\ufb01rm early diagnosis, avoiding repeating the biopsy with increased risk of complications and a delay in treat- ment initiation. Many commonly used procedures in diagnosing lung cancer include \ufb01ber optic bronchoscopy with or without transbronchial needle aspiration, endobronchial ultrasonography, image-guided trans-thoracic needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, pleural \ufb02uid analysis (thoracentesis), thoracoscopy, and surgical approaches. These procedures are costly, prone to complications, and there is a possible need for more samples [ 36 ]. Bridging between Traditional and New Screening Methods The introduction of testing for biomarkers made the most use of lung tissue biopsies by testing for mutations. The most common targetable mutation in the gene  EGFR , for which testing has been part of the standard practice since 2011, is not continuously assessed. It has been suggested that re\ufb02ex testing can reduce the time to initiating treatment. Another setback is that tissue samples from biopsies are often suf\ufb01cient for diagnosis but inadequate for biomarker testing, requiring recurrent biopsies, which might be challenging from a risk, cost, and patient preference standpoint. Tests may fail due to technical reasons. Proper diagnosis needs the collaboration of a multi-disciplinary system working with pulmonology or interventional radiology to ensure enough tissue is obtained at diagnosis for testing [ 20 , 37 ]. Oncomine (testing  EGFR ,  BRAF , and  ROS1  only), MSK IMPACT (Integrated Mutation Pro\ufb01ling of Actionable Cancer Targets), and Foundation One CDx are FDA-approved next- generation sequencing (NGS)-based platforms for molecular testing. Broader NGS-based assays can evaluate emerging biomarkers in a single test to reduce the cost, test more patients, and reduce the need for recurrent biopsies. One of the basic NGS assays commonly used in clinical molecular laboratories is the amplicon-based assay using multiple PCR primers to amplify genomic regions of interest directly. However, these assays have limitations in the number of genes and areas that can be effectively covered at once. As a result, these assays are typically small panels covering hot spots or highly selected clinical interest regions [ 38 , 39 ]. One of the critical issues facing practicing oncologists is whether to test tissue biopsy vs. liquid biopsy, primarily plasma-based circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assays, and whether ctDNA can now replace a biopsy or recurrent biopsies in some clinical settings [ 39 , 40 ]. However, this analysis is not practical for lung cancer diagnosis because mutations ob- served in cfDNA in peripheral blood do not necessarily coincide with the tumor-derived DNA from the same individual. Moreover, cfDNA can also be found in healthy individ- uals [ 41 ], making it a complicated task to differentiate cfDNA from non-tumor tissues. Although an alternative to circumvent this issue is the sequence of mutations in these cfDNA, non-tumor tissues might develop mutations that originated from the hematopoi- etic stem cells. These mutations originate from clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) as a result of somatic mutations acquired with age [ 42 ]. Barriers to early lung cancer screening and diagnosis by traditional methods (dis- cussed earlier) could be overcome with a simple, accurate, reproducible, and inexpensive Int. J. Mol. Sci.  2021 ,  22 , 8661 8 of 18 yearly test as a general screening tool. Several biomarkers are emerging as tools for de- tecting early diagnosis. Because serologic biomarkers can be analyzed conveniently and economically, they are adequate for mass screening. Serologic biomarkers that are cur- rently available for NSCLC are carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and serum cytokeratin 19 fragments (CYFRA 21-1) detailed below [ 43 ]. Peripheral bio\ufb02uids, such as sera, are a preferred source of samples for identifying biomarkers for the early detection of tumors. Research has suggested that the early detection of lung cancer could be achieved by analyzing biomarkers in tissue samples from within the respiratory tract, including sputum, saliva, nasal/bronchial airway epithelial cells, and exhaled breath condensate. Moreover, the use of blood-borne biomarkers (liquid biopsies) includes circulating nucleic acids, proteins, and tumor cells (CTCs). Although the evaluation of these biomarkers requires a minimally invasive approach, it is also repeatable and inexpensive compared to imaging [ 44 ]."

      "refined_text": "In practice, the cornerstones of lung cancer assessment are radiology and tissue biopsies, as discussed earlier. Between missing early diagnosis, cost, and their risks, especially thoracic oncology biopsies, introducing the use of techniques as simple as a blood test provides a much safer and faster option. A review at the MD Anderson Cancer Center assessing cancer biopsies showed more than 17% adverse effects for thoracic biopsies [ 45 ]. 8.1. cfDNA This is a liquid biopsy that analyzes circulating free DNA (cfDNA) and CTCs via a non-invasive method, such as a routine blood draw or urine sample. cfDNA is released by normal cells and cells exhibiting pathologic processes (e.g., in\ufb02ammation and neoplasia). Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a subset of cfDNA released by tumor cells that occurs through a combination of apoptosis, necrosis, and secretion. Analysis of the genetic alterations include point mutations, methylation patterns, chromosomal rearrangements, structural rearrangements, and copy number variations. Examples of cells contributing to cfDNA include the cells turning over due to: (i) Normal processes (e.g., lining of the gut), (ii) in\ufb02ammatory events or other immune-mediated processes, and (iii) neoplastic phenomena. Thus, ctDNA is a tumor shed product. Normally, phagocytes clear cellular debris; however, this does not happen competently in solid tumors since cellular debris accumulates and is released into the blood [ 46 ]. Epigenetic screening is concerned with structural changes in chromosomal regions unrelated to DNA changes that mark altered activity states and show potential lung cancer diagnostic markers. DNA methylation and histone modi\ufb01cation modulate gene expression that could in\ufb02uence early lung cancer detection [ 47 ]. Although the use of cfDNA showed promising results, further analyses of the pub- lished studies showed a different picture. For instance, a metanalysis comprised of 10 stud- ies using cfDNA showed that a pool sensitivity of 0.8 was calculated with a range of 0.48 to 0.91 across the studies [ 48 ]. In the case of the speci\ufb01city, a pool speci\ufb01city of 0.77 was calculated, ranging between 0.47 to 1. Following this line of variation between the studies, an inconsistency of 86.6% and 93.4% was calculated by I-square [ 48 ]. These results signify that the pooled sensitivity and speci\ufb01city of the studies are the result of heterogeneity rather than chance. 8.2. Blood Circulating Antigens A number of antigens found in blood have been assessed over the years as potential biomarkers of lung cancer. The most studied biomarkers include CYFRA 21-1, carcinoem- briogenic antigen (CEA), neuron speci\ufb01c enolase (NSE), and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag). The following table is provided as an illustration of the sensitivities and speci\ufb01cities reported by clinical trials (Table  2 ). Int. J. Mol. Sci.  2021 ,  22 , 8661 9 of 18"

      "refined_text": "Screening of high-risk groups allows for early detection at a treatable and curable stage. As mentioned above, high-risk involves a history of heavy smoking (more than 30 pack- year), current smokers, or smokers who have quit less than 15 years ago, and between 55 and 80 years. Given that the American Cancer Society predicted 135,720 lung cancer deaths in 2020, more widespread screening could save 30,000\u201360,000 lives in the United States each year. The US Preventive Services Task Force USPSTF recommended lowering the starting age for screening from 55 to 50 years and the smoking history requirements from 30 to 20 pack-years. Medical providers have also recommended getting familiar with lung cancer screening guidelines and prescribing these exams for high-risk patients. Currently, only a fraction of the recommended population is screened [ 23 \u2013 25 ]. 6.2. Radiographic Screening and Diagnosis In Japan, a study observed that annual clinic-based chest X-ray screening for lung can- cer reduced 25% of lung cancer mortality for subjects screened annually [ 26 ]. Interestingly, results published from a study performed in Osaka, Japan, showed that high-risk smoker screening using low-dose helical computed tomography (LDCT) showed a reduction of 20% in lung cancer compared to standard radiographic screening [ 27 ]. In lung cancer diagnosis using chest radiography, the sensitivity for tumor detection is roughly 1 cm in diameter, which already has over 10 9   cells with a potential of disrupted bronchial and vascular epithelia. CT is more effective in detecting peripheral lung lesions than plain radiography or conventional tomography of the whole lung. Spiral CT scans can continuously acquire data resulting in a shorter scanning time, a lower radiation exposure, and improved diagnostic accuracy than plain radiography. Then, this technique can image the whole chest in a very short time (one or two breath-holds), with a concomitant reduction in artifacts with a better outcome in missing nodules. Nodules as small as 1\u20135 mm can be shown with modern spiral CT technology. Lung cancer screening is now routinely done using CT, with or without additional adjunct tests such as sputum cytology. Two barriers that discourage its implementation for the general population are cost and accessibility. Furthermore, exposure to low-dose radiation increases the risk of a patient eventually developing breast, thyroid, or lung cancer, especially if they undergo multiple CT scans. LDCT may identify abnormalities that are not cancer (false positives) that require patients to undergo more invasive testing such as biopsies and surgery to remove the anomaly, presenting additional intra- and post-operative risks and complications [ 26 , 27 ]. Spiral CT scans have shown a better diagnostic ability for peripherally small tumor identi\ufb01cation. However, the sensitivity of spiral CT for more centrally located tumors (primarily squamous cell carcinoma) is signi\ufb01cantly lower than for peripherally located tumors [ 27 ]. Notably, approximately 40% of all participants recruited in the LDCT of the National Lung Screening Trial showed at least one positive screen, registering 96% false positives [ 28 ]. The high percentage of false-positive can be translated into costly screening and invasive procedures on smoking subjects free of lung cancer. Taken together, the screening of lung cancer using less expensive instruments and non-invasive techniques is a high priority in diagnosing lung cancer. Int. J. Mol. Sci.  2021 ,  22 , 8661 6 of 18 6.3. Sputum Examination Another diagnostic procedure of lung cancer is the cytological examination of sputa, especially multiple samples, which helps detect central tumors from the larger bronchi (e.g., squamous- and small-cell carcinomas). In general, sputum samples failed to detect small adenocarcinomas (diameter  \u2264 2 cm) that originated from the airway rami\ufb01cations, such as small bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli. This has become of greater importance because cigarette exposure changes (\ufb01lters and decreased nicotine content) have increased adenocarcinomas and decreased squamous carcinomas. Sputum cytology\u2019s sensitivity for early lung cancer is only in the 20\u201330% range from screening studies. Early studies showed that the ability to detect pre-malignant conditions depends on different factors such as the number and type of cells (deeper airways) [ 29 ]. Studies have also concluded that sputum cytology was insuf\ufb01ciently insensitive or accurate to be included in the routine workup of any patient suspected of having lung cancer [ 30 ]. Studies have shown that perhaps immunostaining could provide a more favorable outcome compared to sputum cytology. For example, an 8-year study at the Johns Hopkins hospital collected annual sputum specimens from individuals screened with known clinical outcomes. The sputum specimens were archived and screened for biomarkers that could indicate lung tumors in an early or pre-invasive stage [ 31 ]. As a result of this investigation, two monoclonal antibodies were studied to distinguish the pattern of marker expression. Results showed that positive staining with these antibodies predicted subsequent lung cancer approximately two years before clinical recognition of the disease based on chest X-ray and cytology. In addition, one of these antibodies (703D4) showed higher sensitivity and was later identi\ufb01ed as recognizing the protein heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A2/B1 [ 32 ]. Following this study, the role of hnRNP A2/B1 overexpression for detecting pre-clinical lung cancer was studied in a large high-risk population, including 6000 Chinese tin miners who were heavy smokers and had an elevated lung cancer rate. This study indicated that the expression of hnRNP A2/B1 in epithelium cells from sputum was 2- to 3-fold more sensitive for early detection of lung cancer than standard chest X-ray and sputum cytology methods [ 31 ]. 6.4. Bronchoscopy and Lung Tissue Biopsy White light bronchoscopy (WLB) is the most commonly used diagnostic tool for obtaining a de\ufb01nite histological diagnosis of lung cancer. However, bronchoscopy has signi\ufb01cant diagnostic limitations for pre-malignant lesions. These lesions are hard to detect visually because they are composed of a few layers of cells with a thickness of 0.2\u20131 mm and a diameter of a few millimeters. It appears that the visualization or detection of these small squamous lesions requires a high level of training, as only 29% of the cases were detected by an experienced bron- choscopist. The development of \ufb02uorescence bronchoscopy addressed this limitation. However, although this method could localize early invasive and in situ cancers, the detection of dysplasia remained problematic. Furthermore, photodynamic diagnostic sys- tems\u2019 development was hampered by problems in sensitizing and interference with tissue auto\ufb02uorescence. A new laser photodynamic diagnostic system was developed using tumor-speci\ufb01c drug \ufb02uorescence at 630 nm wavelength to overcome this. This wavelength is well separated from the typical endogenous \ufb02uorescence of the tissues, which ranges 500\u2013580 nm. Using a high-quality charge-coupled device and unique algorithm, the LIFE-lung Fluorescence Endoscopy was developed under the principle that dysplastic and malignant tissues reduce auto\ufb02uorescence signals compared with normal tissues [ 33 ]. Several studies have been performed comparing the diagnostic speci\ufb01city and sen- sitivity of LIFE bronchoscopy vs. WLB in diagnosing pre-invasive and early invasive lesions. Most of the studies reported a higher diagnostic sensitivity of LIFE bronchoscopy in detecting pre-malignant and early malignant lesions at the cost of lower speci\ufb01city (i.e., more false-positive results). Surprisingly, the prevalence of pre-invasive and early lung Int. J. Mol. Sci.  2021 ,  22 , 8661 7 of 18 cancer varies widely from one study to another. These \ufb02uctuations can be the result of the experience level of the operators. Interestingly, the use of LIFE bronchoscopy identi\ufb01ed a new morphological entity de- \ufb01ned as Angiogenic Squamous Dysplasia (ASD). In a morphological study, angiodysplasia changes were frequently found in pre-neoplastic and early malignant lesions in the bronchi. This \ufb01nding has been con\ufb01rmed in pre-neoplasia among smokers. Thus, the signi\ufb01cance of ASD for long-term follow-up and future studies evaluating the role of ASD as a biomarker for early lesions is an area of great interest [ 34 \u2013 37 ]."

      "refined_text": "The use of liquid biopsies could be in the form of introducing lung cancer genetic, transcriptomic, and epigenetic screening biomarkers to determine potential high-risk subjects as a preliminary screening before the use of CT. Thus, early diagnostic using biomarkers could diagnose intermediate nodules identi\ufb01ed by CT, leading to selecting subjects that need a surgical biopsy and saving others who do not need it. Liquid biopsies have clinical applications in early detection, tracking primary and metastatic foci, assessing and monitoring treatment, and treatment resistance. However, they come with a setback regarding mass implementation in that they require complicated analytical methods to analyze. Nevertheless, projects like the FDA Sequencing Quality Control Phase II (SEQC2) project and the Blood Pro\ufb01ling Atlas in Cancer (BloodPAC) consortium have focused on these aspects [ 55 ]. Liquid biopsies allow for the non-invasive analysis of body \ufb02uids for DNA-shed products and aberrant circulating cells. They have also been assessed as a pillar in the precision medicine \ufb01eld, as genetic analysis provides quantitative feedback and monitors patient responses, enabling a more precise, personalized, and practical approach towards individualized treatment. The ability to use these non-invasive methods of analyzing liquid biopsies, such as plasma, saliva, pleural effusions, CSF, or urine at the clinic, is considered technological progress in immune-oncology. Extensively studying and subtyping NSCLC through genetic analyses enables molec- ular understanding, resulting in more effective therapeutic options, signi\ufb01cantly reducing toxicity pro\ufb01les through target treatment of NSCLC subtypes (e.g.,  EGFR ,  ALK , and  ROS1 ). Unfortunately, not many patients use target therapies. Nearly 80% of cancer patients do not have genetic mutation results available during the initial consult with an oncologist, and approximately25% begin cancer treatment before receiving results. Molecular diagnostic companies offer rapid services to overcome this issue, where whole blood is shipped overnight to identify ctDNA mutations (in  EGFR  and  KRAS ) using commercially available droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), and the results are reported within 72 h [ 61 ]. One of the challenges in using liquid biopsies to detect mutations arises from the dif\ufb01culty of very low-frequency mutation detection. This might happen after lung cancer surgery for a curative intent (i.e., a small, localized tumor) as the source of ctDNA shed was removed, due to the continued clearance of ctDNA by the kidneys. In these cases, Int. J. Mol. Sci.  2021 ,  22 , 8661 11 of 18 postoperative blood potentially requires the detection of mutations of  \u2264 0.1%. Therefore, the improvement of speci\ufb01city and sensitivity of lung biopsies is a \ufb01eld of technological research that could be used as adjuvant therapy and cancer screening."
